In this challenge, you are provided with an encrypted flag, a key, and an Initialization Vector (IV). Your task is to write a script or use online tools to decrypt the flag and unveil the hidden message. This challenge will help you understand the basics of AES encryption and decryption, and get a taste of real-world cryptographic practices.

Here's what you need to get started:

```
Encrypted Flag: pdl3hAmvBFVFcdeFQmwB4CttDlH1tqECmML1BLV9kuc=
Key: R34LLYSTR0NGK3Y!
Initialization Vector (IV): randomiv12345678
```

You can use the Python programming language and the pycryptodome library, or online tools like CyberChef to decrypt the flag. Remember, the flag follows the format Spark{...}.

To help you kickstart this decryption journey, a `template.py` file has been provided. You just need to fill in the required information and run the script to decrypt the flag.

Are you ready to embark on this cryptographic journey and uncover the hidden flag? Your AES Adventure begins now!
